# Van Life

## Introduction

Simple app built to learn about **React Router 6**, for client-side routing,
following Bob Ziroll's Advanced React course on Scrimba. I later applied what I
learned on my own project [Bits&Bobs](https://bits-and-bobs.netlify.app) and
many more.

I've split the project in 2 repos to keep 2 different ways of doing the same
thing. **This one includes Part 2's topics**.

Topics covered - Part 1:

- Routing basics
- Navigation
- Layout and Index routes, relative vs absolute paths
- Nested routes, useOutletContext()
- Route and search params

Topics covered - Part 2:

- Loaders
- Actions
- Protected Routes

## Functionalities

Single Page App with 10+ routes, features include:

- filter by van type
- active nav link styling
- nested routes multiple levels deep
- using a real database (Firebase)
- deployed on Netlify

## Setup

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will
complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)
