# Van Life

## Introduction

Simple app/exercise built to learn about **React Router 6**, for client-side
routing, following Bob Ziroll's Advanced React course on Scrimba. I later
applied everything I learned on my own project
[Bits&Bobs](https://bits-and-bobs.netlify.app). Topics covered:

- Routing basics
- Navigation
- Layout and Index routes
- Nested routes
- Route and search params
- Protected routes

## Functionalities

Single Page App with 10+ routes, features include:

- filter by van type
- active nav link styling
- nested routes multiple levels deep
- using a real database (Firebase)
- deployed on Netlify

## Setup

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will
complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)
